          <strong>The 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup</strong> was the 13th
          Cricket World Cup. a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket
          tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the
          International Cricket Council (ICC). It was hosted from 5 October to
          19 November 2023 across ten venues in India. This was the fourth World
          Cup held in India, but the first where India was the sole host.<br />
          The tournament was contested by ten national teams, maintaining the
          same format used in 2019. After six weeks of round-robin matches,
          India, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand finished as the top
          four and qualified for the knockout stage. In the knockout stage,
          India and Australia beat New Zealand and South Africa, respectively,
          to advance to the final, played on 19 November at the Narendra Modi
          Stadium in Ahmedabad. Australia won the final by six wickets, winning
          their sixth Cricket World Cup title. A total of 1,250,307 spectators
          attended the matches, the highest number in any Cricket World Cup to
          date.[1] The tournament final set viewership records in India, drawing
          518 million viewers, with a peak of 57 million streaming viewers.

        <h2>Host Selection</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales
          withdrew their bid to host the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was
          played in Australia and New Zealand. It was the fifth Cricket World
          Cup played in England, following the 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999 World
          Cups. Wales also hosted matches at the 1983 and 1999 tournaments, the
          latter also seeing matches played in Scotland, Ireland and the
          Netherlands.[3][4]

      <h2>Format</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
       This was the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates were given to bowling sides if they did not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.[9]

        <h2>Qualifications</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Other than India, who qualified as hosts, all teams had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023.

As a result of the qualifying process, the competition was the first not to include former winners West Indies, who failed to progress for the first time after their defeat to Scotland.[25] Full members Ireland and Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the knock-out qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing.[26] The final qualification spot was decided by an eliminator match between associate members Scotland and the Netherlands,[27] with the Dutch side taking the final place.[25]        </p>

          The 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup final was held at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad, on 19 November 2023, between hosts India and five-time champions Australia. Batting first, India managed to score 240 all out in 50 overs, with Virat Kohli scoring a solid 54 and KL Rahul contributing 66.

In response, Australia chased down the target with confidence, led by a remarkable innings of 137* off 120 balls by Travis Head, who was later named Player of the Match. Despite early pressure, Australia reached the target in just 43 overs, finishing at 241/4 and securing their sixth World Cup title.

The final was marked by high expectations from the Indian crowd, but Australia’s clinical performance in both bowling and batting silenced the home fans and reaffirmed their dominance in World Cup history.
