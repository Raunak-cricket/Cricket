        <strong>The 2011 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup</strong> was the tenth Cricket World Cup.
        It was played in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, with the latter hosting matches for the first time.
        India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by six wickets in the final at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai,
        becoming the first country to win the World Cup final on home soil. Yuvraj Singh was declared Player of the Tournament.
        This was the first time two Asian teams met in a World Cup final, and the first final since 1992 without Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourteen teams participated, including 10 full ICC members and four associate members.
        The opening ceremony was held on 17 February 2011 at Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka.
        The tournament ran from 19 February to 2 April. The first match was India vs. Bangladesh at Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur.

      <h2>Host Selection</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        On 30 April 2006, the ICC announced that India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan would co-host the 2011 World Cup.
        Australia and New Zealand had also submitted a joint bid but lost by a vote of 10–3.
        The support of the West Indies was reportedly decisive in Asia winning the bid.
        Promises of greater profits and fundraising efforts for West Indies cricket may have influenced the vote.

  In the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final, India’s top batting order faced an early collapse after losing both openers quickly — Virender Sehwag was dismissed for a duck, and Sachin Tendulkar followed shortly after. However, Gautam Gambhir played a crucial knock, anchoring the innings with a vital 97 runs. Later, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni promoted himself up the order and delivered a match-winning unbeaten 91. Along with Yuvraj Singh’s composed finishing role, these efforts led India to a historic victory over Sri Lanka by six wickets, making India the first country to win the World Cup final on home soil.
