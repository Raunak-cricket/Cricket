        <strong>The 2019 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup</strong> was the 12th Cricket World Cup.
        a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament was hosted between 30 May and 14 July across 10 venues in England and a single venue in Wales. It was the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup, and the third time matches had been played in Wales.<br>

      <p>
         The tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams in the previous edition, with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a result, India, Australia, England, and New Zealand finished as the top four, with Pakistan missing out on net run rate.

In the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the final, which was played at Lord's in London. The final ended in a tie after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 runs, followed by the first Super Over in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. The total attendance throughout the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was 752,000.[1] Overall, videos of the group stages amassed over 2.6 billion views from around the world, making it the most-watched cricket competition as of 2019.[2]

      <h2>Host Selection</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>

The hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was played in Australia and New Zealand. It was the fifth Cricket World Cup played in England, following the 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999 World Cups. Wales also hosted matches at the 1983 and 1999 tournaments, the latter also seeing matches played in Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.[3][4]

      <h2>Qualifications</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
     The 2019 World Cup featured 10 teams, a decrease from previous World Cups in 2011 and 2015, which each featured 14 teams.[5] The hosts (England) and the top seven other teams in the ICC One Day International rankings on 30 September 2017 earned an automatic qualification.[6] Results from 19 September 2017 confirmed that these teams were Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka.[7] The remaining two spots were decided by the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.[6]

At the time of the announcement of the qualification structure, ICC Associate and Affiliate Members, who were guaranteed four spots in the previous two World Cup tournaments, could now only be represented by at most two teams, and possibly none at all if they were beaten by the lowest-ranked Full Members in the Qualifier.[6] It also meant that at least two of the ten Test-playing nations at the time of the announcement would have to play in the qualifying tournament, and could miss the World Cup finals entirely. Thus, this was the first World Cup to be contested without all of the Full Member nations being present.[8]

The final stage of the tournament was a "Super Six" group, from which the top two teams qualified for the 2019 World Cup. The West Indies were guaranteed a spot after defeating Scotland in the penultimate round.[9] Afghanistan joined them after defeating Ireland in the final over of their match.[10] This was the first time since 1983 that Zimbabwe had failed to qualify for a World Cup.[11] Ireland also missed the competition for the first time since 2007,[12] and, for the first time, no Associate nation participated.[13]

  The 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup final took place at Lord’s, London on 14 July 2019, between England and New Zealand. Batting first, New Zealand posted a total of 241/8 in their 50 overs, with Henry Nicholls scoring a steady 55 and Tom Latham contributing 47. England, in response, also scored 241 all out, thanks to Ben Stokes’ heroic 84 off 98 balls*.

The match ended in a tie, leading to the first-ever Super Over in a World Cup final. Both teams scored 15 runs in the Super Over, but England were declared winners based on the boundary count-back rule (England 26 boundaries, New Zealand 17). It was the closest and most dramatic final in ODI World Cup history, earning England their maiden World Cup title.
